  /**
   *  Takes elements for the specified duration from the start of the observable source sequence, using the specified scheduler to run timers.
   *
   * @example
   *  1 - res = source.takeWithTime(5000,  [optional scheduler]);
   * @description
   *  This operator accumulates a queue with a length enough to store elements received during the initial duration window.
   *  As more elements are received, elements older than the specified duration are taken from the queue and produced on the
   *  result sequence. This causes elements to be delayed with duration.
   * @param ***REMOVED***Number***REMOVED*** duration Duration for taking elements from the start of the sequence.
   * @param ***REMOVED***Scheduler***REMOVED*** scheduler Scheduler to run the timer on. If not specified, defaults to Rx.Scheduler.timeout.
   * @returns ***REMOVED***Observable***REMOVED*** An observable sequence with the elements taken during the specified duration from the start of the source sequence.
